 Title: Implementation and Evaluation of a Neural Network for Predicting Bank Term Deposit Subscriptions

 Abstract

This paper presents the development and evaluation of a neural network model for predicting customer subscription to a term deposit using a bank marketing dataset. The model employs fundamental neural network principles, including forward and backward propagation, activation functions, and parameter optimization. The model's performance, evaluated in terms of accuracy, demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting client subscriptions.

 1. Introduction

Predictive modeling is vital in various business domains, including marketing. This study focuses on predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using a neural network. The dataset consists of customer demographics and campaign interactions. This paper details the dataset preparation, neural network architecture, training process, and performance evaluation.

 2. Dataset Preparation

The dataset is obtained from a bank marketing campaign and includes various attributes related to customer demographics and marketing interactions. The data is initially loaded and prepared by dropping irrelevant or redundant columns. The target variable, which indicates whether a client subscribed to a term deposit, is binary-encoded (0 for 'no' and 1 for 'yes'). The features and target variable are then separated for model training.

#### 3. Neural Network Architecture

The neural network model consists of the following layers:
- **Input Layer**: Includes the features from the dataset.
- **Hidden Layers**: Two hidden layers, each with 10 nodes.
- **Output Layer**: A single node representing the binary classification outcome.

The model's parameters are initialized with small random values for weights and zeros for biases. This initialization is crucial for effective training.

#### 4. Forward Propagation

Forward propagation involves calculating the activations for each layer using the sigmoid activation function. The process involves computing linear combinations of the inputs and weights, followed by applying the sigmoid function to introduce non-linearity. This step generates predictions from the input data.

#### 5. Error Computation

The error, or loss, is computed using cross-entropy loss, which measures the difference between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes. The cross-entropy loss is averaged over all examples to quantify the model's prediction error.

#### 6. Backward Propagation

Backward propagation calculates the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters. This step involves computing the derivatives of the loss function for each weight and bias in the network. These gradients are used to update the parameters to minimize the loss.

#### 7. Parameter Update

The model parameters are updated using gradient descent. The learning rate, or alpha, controls the step size for each parameter update. The updated parameters aim to reduce the loss and improve the model's performance.

#### 8. Training the Neural Network

The neural network is trained over a specified number of iterations. During each iteration, forward propagation is performed to compute predictions, the error is calculated, backward propagation updates the parameters, and the parameters are refined. This iterative process continues until the model converges or reaches the specified number of iterations.

#### 9. Prediction and Accuracy

After training, the model is used to make predictions on the dataset. The predictions are rounded to the nearest integer to obtain binary outcomes. The model's accuracy is calculated by comparing the predicted values to the actual outcomes, resulting in an accuracy of 88%.

#### 10. Conclusion

The neural network model achieves an accuracy of 88% in predicting client subscriptions to term deposits. This result highlights the model's effectiveness in handling the given dataset. Future work could involve further hyperparameter tuning, exploring different network architectures, and validating the model on additional datasets to enhance its predictive performance.
